    "## CNN trained on a custom dataset for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to train an image classifier from scratch in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before you proceed with this notebook**, you need to collect the data for the classes you wish to create. To do so, you can follow any of these approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download public image datasets from Kaggle, e.g. [animal image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install [`gallery-dl`](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl). This library allows us to download entire image galleries from sites such as [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/), [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), and [bbc](https://www.bbc.co.uk/). Go to [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/) and search for a category of your interest. Then, click the filter on the left side and select the option for **Boards**. Select a board and then copy the URL of the pinterest board (e.g. https://www.pinterest.co.uk/user/board-id/) as an argument for the command below. e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `gallery-dl https://www.pinterest.co.uk/user-id/board-id/`\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can run the above command directly in the terminal or through this notebook by adding a `!` before the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Make sure you keep track of the directory where you are when downloading the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record or source videos of objects, and use `ffmpeg` to extract frames from them. This is a quick way to get many variations of an object. Some quick instructions for `ffmpeg`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n",
    "    Then, open the terminal, move into the directory (cd PATH) where you have the video you want to transform into frames, create a folder to save your frames in it and run the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `ffmpeg -i file_name.mov -r 1 -s WxH folder_name/%03d.jpeg`\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will extract one video frame per second from the video and will output them in files named 001.jpeg, 002.jpeg, etc. Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values (you can skipp -s WxH if you do not wish to resize your images). Look [here](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) for more information on `ffmpeg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After you have collected your images** (a folder of images per class), put them into the `data` folder in the current directory, so that you can access them from the path:\n",
    "\n",
    "`./data/custom-image-dataset/`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can proceed with the notebook. The following code has been adapted from notebook developed by [Terence Broad](https://github.com/terrybroad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you run this code, you can compare it with the code in the notebook `04`. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Task 1:** Create your own dataset with 2, 3, or more classes, based on one of the suggested approaches. It would be effective to have at least 1000 images/class. Create a folder for each one of your classes and save the respective images there. Then move all of the class folders in `./data/custom-image-dataset`. Make sure you manually clean-up your data before training, to remove any irrelevant or destroyed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2:** Run all the cells in this code to train a classifier on your custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 3:** Add image transformations on the training dataset. Look in [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) and [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/auto_examples/transforms/plot_transforms_illustrations.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-transforms-plot-transforms-illustrations-py) for references and examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 4:** Create a new notebook where you call the model that you just saved from this training and test it on some new unseen data. Look into the MNIST notebooks 01 and 02, as well as the PyTorch website, to figure out how you can call and use an already trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenges:**\n",

    "\n",
    "For this to work, you will have to initialise best_loss with a high value before you enter the training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus 2:** In this example you are building your classifier from scratch, i.e. you decide yourself what the architecture of the network is and you train it from the very beginning. Could you explore a way for training your classifier based on a pre-trained model? There are many available pre-trained models in [the torchvision models library](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html), like [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) which is trained on [imagenet dataset](https://www.image-net.org/). This approach will require a few changes and additions in your notebook. Attempt it if you are feeling adventurous!"
